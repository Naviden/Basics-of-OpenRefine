# Loading and Exploring Data in OpenRefine

## Starting OpenRefine

To start OpenRefine:
1. Launch the application and open your browser to `http://localhost:3333`
2. Create a new project by uploading a file, entering a URL, pasting clipboard content, or using a database connection.

## Exploring the Data

Once a project is created, your data is displayed in a spreadsheet-like grid. Rows represent records, and columns represent attributes.

### Useful Interface Features

- **Rows vs Records**: A record can span multiple rows if it contains nested data. Use the toggle at the top to switch view modes.
- **Facets**: Provide interactive filters for exploring the data. You can apply facets on text, numbers, blanks, etc.
- **Histograms**: Numeric facets offer histograms for understanding distributions.

### Viewing Modes

- **Row mode**: View each row individually.
- **Record mode**: Group rows that belong to the same logical record.

### Sorting and Pagination

You can sort columns by value, or reorder them manually. Change how many rows to display using the pagination control.
