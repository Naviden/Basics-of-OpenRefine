# Introduction to OpenRefine

OpenRefine is a powerful, open-source desktop application for working with messy data. Originally developed by Google, it allows users to explore, clean, and transform datasets interactively. It supports importing various formats, applying transformations, identifying inconsistencies, and linking with external data sources.

## Key Advantages
- **Privacy**: By default, OpenRefine runs entirely locally on your machine, and your data is not sent to any external server unless you explicitly perform an action that requires it.
- **No coding required**: All operations can be performed using a graphical user interface.
- **Cross-platform**: Runs on Windows, MacOS, and Linux using your browser.
- **Transparent operations**: Every step you take is recorded and can be reviewed, edited, and applied to other datasets.
- **Community support and extensions**: Itâ€™s open-source and extensible with plugins.

## Common Use Cases

- Cleaning data with typos and inconsistent formatting
- Standardizing data (e.g., turning all dates into a common format)
- De-duplicating records
- Extracting structured data from web services
- Reconciling data with authoritative datasets (e.g., DBpedia, Wikidata)
